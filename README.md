# belly-button-challenge

In this assignment I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
A horizontal bar chart was created with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual. In addition a bubble chart that displays each sample was created.
Display of sample metadata was added, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

Utilized: Java Script, Plotly, D3
